# AmbientSpec

AmbientSpec turns your RSpec specs into ambient music. Sweet sounds come from
passing examples, and gongs signal failing tests.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ambient_spec'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ambient_spec

## Usage

Simply run rspec as you normally would.

To disable AmbientSpec, set `ENV['AMBIENT_SPEC_DISABLED']=true`
